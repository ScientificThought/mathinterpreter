# mathinterpreter
## **An interpreter for evaluating simple math expressions.**

mathinterpreter evaluates simple math calculations through command line and console. This project is based on  [py-simple-math-interpreter](https://github.com/davidcallanan/py-simple-math-interpreter), by David Callanan, and illustrates the use of software engineering techniques to evolve a prototype code into a professional software.

Since our objective is to create an education/professional example we didn't change the original business logic, *i.e.*, we do not change the interpretor code. Besides the four basic operations ( addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) we implemented the power operator `^` to calculate `a^b` and the modulo operator `%`.

## How to install and run the REPL

### Using pipx (recommended)

To use this project as a standalone command line tool install [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) and run:

```bash
pipx install mathinterpreter
```
At this point you can run the console from anywhere in your machine by typing `mathinterpreter` in your terminal console. 
This will open the console terminal of the interpreter and you can now use it for evaluating math expressions:
```
$ mathinterpreter
calc > 1+1        
2.0
calc > (3.0+2*2)/3
2.3333333333333335
calc > q
$ 
```
Just type `q` or `quit` followed by enter in the console to return to your shell. 

Alternatively you can also provide math expressions as parameters to `mathinterpreter`, as described below:
```
$ mathinterpreter 1+1
2.0
$ mathinterpreter "1 + 1"
2.0
$ 
```
For more examples, use `mathinterpreter -h`. That's it.


### Install using pip

If you want to install this package and use it as a library on another project you can use `pip` and a virtual environment manager.  There are many ways to do that but if you already know how to setup a virtual environment, probably you could proceed your way. 

In our development setup we use `venv`, which comes with python, on Ubuntu Linux. If you are new to software development, follow the steps we recommend below which is expect to work on any Linux Distribution.

Create a new directory and a new virtual environment for working with `mathinterpreter`:

```bash
mkdir mynewproject
cd mynewproject
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
Note that `mynewproject` could be any name of your choice and that instead of using `source` you could simply use the `.` command. After activating your new environment, install the package from source using pip:

```bash
python -m pip install mathinterpreter
```
Through this procedure you can run `mathinterpreter` inside the virtual environment you just created and import 
`mathinterpreter` as a library to use in your project, as we discuss below.


### How to use this package as Python module

You can import the module `mathinterpreter` from your python code and use the function `calc` to evaluate expressions, as in the following:
```python
from mathinterpreter import calc

value = calc('1 + 3*(5*2+1)/2')
print(value)
```
To using `mathinterpreter` as a library you will need to import the Lexer, the Parser, and the Interpreter classes. 
For understanding how the interpreter works we recommend you to look the files `mathinterpreter/__main__.py` and `mathinterpreter/calculate.py`, which implement the Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) console.
